## Pigsty OSS

> Free under the AGPLv3 License, No Warranty

Pigsty is built on open source and also gives back to the open source community. It is a gift to the PostgreSQL community and all users — you can obtain the complete core functionality of Pigsty without any payment. Of course, as is typical with open-source software, the Pigsty Open Source Edition does not offer any warranty service and bears no responsibility for any consequences arising from its use. If you require a warranty, please consider our subscription services.

The Pigsty Open Source Edition is released under the [**AGPLv3**](https://pigsty.io/docs/about/license/) license, which is a copyleft, strict open-source license.
If you are an ordinary end user (i.e., users other than public cloud vendors or database vendors), we will not pursue any action against your secondary development of Pigsty.
In practice, it is effectively licensed under the more permissive [**Apache 2.0**](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license for most end users.

If you discover any defects in Pigsty, we highly encourage you to submit an [**Issue**](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/issues) on GitHub to help us improve. If you have any questions, you can seek help in the [**Community**](https://pigsty.io/docs/about/community/).

For the open-source version, we provide prebuilt standard offline packages for PostgreSQL 17 on three precisely targeted OS distributions—EL 9.4, Debian 12.7, Ubuntu 22.04.5— with the latest minor versions (as a form of open-source support, `aarch64` offline packages are also provided for Debian 12).

By using the Pigsty Open Source Edition, entry-level developers and DevOps engineers can access **70%+** of the capabilities of a professional DBA. Even without a dedicated database expert, you can easily set up a high-availability, high-performance, easy-to-maintain, secure, and reliable PostgreSQL database cluster. If self-hosted in the cloud, you can immediately save on the price difference between EC2/ESSD and RDS services, achieving significant cost reductions up to 90+%.

## Pigsty Standard

> Economical choice for SMBs, startups, and freelancers

The Pigsty Standard subscription provides an affordable safety net for small and medium businesses—we offer warranty and support coverage for the Pigsty software itself. The Standard subscription uses a dedicated commercial license, delivering a written contractual commitment that waives the **AGPLv3** derived work open-source obligations of Pigsty.

We provide a one-time architectural consultation service to Standard subscription customers. Based on your environment and available resources, we will propose a suitable database architecture design. Whether you want to use PostgreSQL to build a business system or self-host Odoo, Dify, Supabase, Gitlab, or other applications, we can provide comprehensive support, including offline installation and network solutions.

The Pigsty Standard subscription includes basic expert ticketing and Q&A services. We commit to responding to your questions within working hours. For more complex issues requiring additional support, our expert support (man-day) service is also available for purchase. Our PostgreSQL expertise can help you avoid numerous pitfalls, saving you time, effort, and costs.

For mainstream open-source Linux distributions (EL9, Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04) at their latest stable minor versions, the Pigsty Standard subscription provides offline software installation packages for both `x86_64` and `aarch64`. These packages include the PostgreSQL 17 kernel and all available extensions, tested to ensure quick, stable, and efficient installation with consistent versions, independent of network environment and upstream repository changes.

The starting price for Pigsty Standard is **8,000 $ / year**, roughly equivalent to the annual fee for **4** vCPUs of AWS HA RDS PG or the salary of an intern with a monthly wage of **$600**.

## Pigsty Professional

> Suitable choice for typical enterprise users

The Pigsty Professional subscription builds upon the Standard offering with more advanced consultation services. The Professional subscription includes analysis of complex issues and performance bottleneck optimization, ensuring you can access top-level DBA expertise at critical moments.

We provide comprehensive architectural consultation for Professional subscription customers. Based on your business needs and resource availability, we develop the optimal database architecture design and ensure its successful implementation. We also assist with high availability testing and PITR exercises, and provide training on Pigsty’s monitoring system, configuration methods, and management commands.

The Pigsty Professional subscription offers enhanced support. We provide one expert man-day per year, along with monthly DBA consultation and Q&A not exceeding five hours. We also offer a faster SLA response time: for routine questions, we guarantee a response within four hours during weekday working hours (5x8).

The Pigsty Professional subscription supports a broader range of operating systems, adding EL 8 and Ubuntu 24.04 to the list of supported distributions, and provides `aarch64` support for all of these versions. If you are not using the latest minor version, we can customize offline software packages for your specified minor version. Moreover, the offline packages include all Pigsty feature modules, such as PG branch kernels (IvorySQL, PolarDB, Babelfish) and all Pro/Beta modules.

Pigsty Professional provides support for the three most recent major PostgreSQL releases (17, 16, 15), and offers expert guidance for PostgreSQL major version upgrades as well as Pigsty upgrades.

The starting price for Pigsty Professional is **24,000 $ / year**, roughly equivalent to the annual fee for **11** vCPUs of AWS HA RDS PG, or the annual salary of a junior DevOps engineer with a monthly wage of **$2,000**.

## Pigsty Enterprise

> Designed for mission-critical scenarios

Pigsty Enterprise is designed for medium and large enterprises or mission-critical scenarios requiring strict SLAs. With the Enterprise subscription, we offer the highest level of support to meet all your database needs.

Under the Enterprise subscription, we help you design and implement the optimal database architecture solution. Beyond database drills, stress tests, and performance evaluations, we also provide consultancy and training on management systems, helping you build a comprehensive database management framework that meets various security and compliance requirements.

Pigsty Enterprise includes two expert man-days per year, plus monthly DBA consultation and Q&A of up to 10 hours. For routine issues, we guarantee a response within 30 minutes, 7x24, and always prioritize your requests.

The Pigsty Enterprise subscription offers the widest range of OS support, adding EL7, Debian 11, and Ubuntu 20.04, including EOL releases.
We can also customize support for Euler, Anolis, UOS, Kylin, TencentOS, AliOS, OpenCloudOS, and other Linux distributions.

The Pigsty Enterprise subscription covers all PostgreSQL major releases (13–17) within their active lifecycles, ensuring smooth in-place upgrades across different major versions. Using the included man-days, you can migrate your PostgreSQL clusters to the latest major version via a zero-downtime, blue-green deployment process.

Pigsty Enterprise permits usage of Pigsty as DBaaS at a specified scale, allowing you to build and sell cloud database services. It also allows OEM use—you may distribute Pigsty with your own logo, trademarks, and branding within the agreed scope.

The starting price for Pigsty Enterprise is **60,000 $ / year**, which is equivalent to **27 vCPUs** of AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, or a developer with a monthly salary of **$5,000**.

## Pricing

Pigsty subscriptions are annual, beginning on the agreed date. Payment before expiration implies automatic renewal. Continuous subscriptions receive discounts: 5% off the second year, 10% off subsequent years, and 15% off for three-year commitments.

After subscription expiration, non-renewal results in cessation of updates, technical support, and consulting, though previously installed Pro software remains usable. Non-renewal gaps do not require back payment upon re-subscription, but loyalty discounts are reset.

Pigsty’s pricing delivers exceptional value—providing immediate access to top-tier DBA expertise and database management practices at a cost that compares favorably to hiring full-time experts or using cloud database services. For reference, market prices for comparable enterprise database services include:

- [AWS RDS for PostgreSQL HA](https://instances.vantage.sh/rds/): $160 – $220 / (vCPU·month), equivalent to **$1,920 - $2,640/year** (**per vCPU**).
- [EDB PostgreSQL Cloud Database Enterprise](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison#edbbiganimalcommunity360plan): $183.3 / (vCPU·month), equivalent to **$2,200/year** (**per vCPU**).
- [Fujitsu Enterprise PostgreSQL Kubernetes](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison#edbbiganimalcommunity360plan): $3,200 / (Core·year), equivalent to **$1,200/year** (**per vCPU**).
- [Oracle Annual Service Fee](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/pricing/technology-price-list-070617.pdf): (Enterprise $47,500 + RAC $23,000) * 22% per year, equivalent to **$3,878/year** (**per vCPU**).

Fair market rates for enterprise database services typically range from **$1K - $4K/year** per **vCPU**.

Pigsty’s pricing offers unmatched cost efficiency, especially on high-end servers.
