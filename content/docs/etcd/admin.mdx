Here are some administration SOP for etcd:

- [Create Cluster](#create-cluster)
- [Remove Cluster](#remove-cluster)
- [CLI Environment](#cli-environment)
- [Reload Config](#reload-config)
- [Add Member](#add-member)
- [Remove Member](#remove-member)

Check [ETCD: FAQ](/etcd/faq) for more questions.


------

## Create Cluster

To create an etcd cluster, define the `etcd` cluster in [inventory](/docs/config/inventory) first:

```yaml
etcd:
  hosts:
    10.10.10.10: { etcd_seq: 1 }
    10.10.10.11: { etcd_seq: 2 }
    10.10.10.12: { etcd_seq: 3 }
  vars: { etcd_cluster: etcd   }
```

Then run the [`etcd.yml`](/etcd/playbook/#etcdyml) playbook.

```bash
./etcd.yml   # init etcd module on group 'etcd'
```

Pigsty has a safeguard mechanism to prevent accidental purge. By default, [`etcd_clean`](/etcd/param#etcd_clean) is `true`, and [`etcd_safeguard`](/etcd/param#etcd_safeguard) is `false`,
which means the playbook will purge etcd cluster even if there are running etcd instances. In this case, `etcd.yml` is truly idempotent,
which is useful for development, testing, and emergency rebuild of etcd cluster in production.

For provisioned etcd cluster in prod env, you can enable safeguard to prevent accidental clean.



------

## Remove Cluster

To remove an existing etcd cluster, use the `etcd_clean` subtask of [`etcd.yml`](/etcd/playbook/#etcdyml), do think before you type.

```bash
./etcd.yml -t etcd_clean  # remove entire cluster, honor the etcd_safeguard
./etcd.yml -t etcd_purge  # purge with brutal force, omit the etcd_safeguard
```

The `etcd_clean` subtask will honor the [`etcd_safeguard`](/etcd/param#etcd_safeguard), while the `etcd_purge` subtask will ignore that and wipe out the entire etcd cluster.




------

## CLI Environment

Pigsty use etcd v3 API by default. (`v2` support is dropped since v3.6.0)

Here’s an example of client environment config.

```bash
alias e="etcdctl"
alias em="etcdctl member"
export ETCDCTL_ENDPOINTS=https://10.10.10.10:2379
export ETCDCTL_CACERT=/etc/pki/ca.crt
export ETCDCTL_CERT=/etc/etcd/server.crt
export ETCDCTL_KEY=/etc/etcd/server.key
```

You can do CRUD with the following commands after setting up the envs:

```bash
e put a 10 ; e get a; e del a ; # V3 API
```



------

## Reload Config

In case of permanent etcd cluster membership changes, You’ll have to refresh the 4 etcd endpoints references:

- config file of existing etcd members
- etcdctl client environment variables
- patroni dcs endpoint config
- vip-manager dcs endpoint config

To refresh etcd config file `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` on existing members:

```bash
./etcd.yml -t etcd_conf                           # refresh /etc/etcd/etcd.conf with latest status
ansible etcd -f 1 -b -a 'systemctl restart etcd'  # optional: restart etcd
```

To refresh `etcdctl` client environment variables

```bash
$ ./etcd.yml -t etcd_env                          # refresh /etc/profile.d/etcdctl.sh
```

To update etcd endpoints reference on `patroni`:

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pg_conf                            # regenerate patroni config
ansible all -f 1 -b -a 'systemctl reload patroni' # reload patroni config
```

To update etcd endpoints reference on `vip-manager`, (optional, if you are using a L2 vip)

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pg_vip_config                           # regenerate vip-manager config
ansible all -f 1 -b -a 'systemctl restart vip-manager' # restart vip-manager to use new config
```




------

## Add Member

ETCD Reference: [Add a member](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/runtime-configuration/#add-a-new-member)

You can add new members to existing etcd cluster in 5 steps:

1. issue `etcdctl member add` command to tell existing cluster that a new member is coming (use learner mode)
2. update inventory group `etcd` with new instance
3. init the new member with `etcd_init=existing`, to join the existing cluster rather than create a new one (**VERY IMPORTANT**)
4. promote the new member from leaner to follower
5. update etcd endpoints reference with [reload-config](#reload-config)

**Short Version**

```bash
etcdctl member add <etcd-?> --learner=true --peer-urls=https://<new_ins_ip>:2380
./etcd.yml -l <new_ins_ip> -e etcd_init=existing
etcdctl member promote <new_ins_server_id>
```


------

## Remove Member

To remove a member from existing etcd cluster, it usually takes 3 steps:

1. remove/uncomment it from inventory and [reload config](#reload-config)
2. remove it with `etcdctl member remove <server_id>` command and kick it out of the cluster
3. temporarily add it back to inventory and purge that instance, then remove it from inventory permanently
