You have to define the etcd cluster in the [config inventory](/docs/config/inventory) before deploying it.

Usually you can choose an etcd cluster with:

- [One Node](#one-node), no high availability, just the functionality of etcd, suitable for development, testing, demonstration.
- [Three Nodes](#three-nodes), basic high availability, tolerate one node failure, suitable for medium production environment.
- [Five Nodes](#five-nodes), better high availability, tolerate two node failure, suitable for large production environment.

Use even number of etcd nodes is meaningless, and more than five nodes is not common.



------

## One Node

Define the group `etcd` in the inventory, It will create a singleton etcd instance.

```yaml
# etcd cluster for ha postgres
etcd: { hosts: { 10.10.10.10: { etcd_seq: 1 } }, vars: { etcd_cluster: etcd } }
```

This line exists almost in all single-node [config](/docs/conf/) templates, where the placeholder IP address `10.10.10.10` will be replaced with the current admin node IP.

The only necessary parameters are [`etcd_seq`](/docs/etcd/param#etcd_seq) and [`etcd_cluster`](/docs/etcd/param#etcd_cluster), which uniquely identify the cluster and each instance.



------

## Three Nodes

It’s common to use a three-node etcd cluster, which can tolerate one node failure, suitable for medium prod env.

The [`trio`](/docs/conf/trio/) and [`safe`](/docs/conf/safe/) config templates use a three-node etcd cluster, as shown below:

```yaml
etcd: # dcs service for postgres/patroni ha consensus
  hosts:  # 1 node for testing, 3 or 5 for production
    10.10.10.10: { etcd_seq: 1 }  # etcd_seq required
    10.10.10.11: { etcd_seq: 2 }  # assign from 1 ~ n
    10.10.10.12: { etcd_seq: 3 }  # odd number please
  vars: # cluster level parameter override roles/etcd
    etcd_cluster: etcd  # mark etcd cluster name etcd
    etcd_safeguard: false # safeguard against purging
    etcd_clean: true # purge etcd during init process
```



------

## Five Nodes

Five nodes etcd cluster can tolerate two node failure, suitable for large prod env.

There’s a five-node etcd cluster example in the [`prod`](/docs/conf/prod) template:

```yaml
etcd:
  hosts:
    10.10.10.21 : { etcd_seq: 1 }
    10.10.10.22 : { etcd_seq: 2 }
    10.10.10.23 : { etcd_seq: 3 }
    10.10.10.24 : { etcd_seq: 4 }
    10.10.10.25 : { etcd_seq: 5 }
  vars: { etcd_cluster: etcd    }
```

You can use more nodes for production environment, but 3 or 5 nodes are recommended. Remember to use odd number for cluster size.

## Etcd Usage

These are the services that currently use Etcd:

- patroni: Use etcd as a consensus backend for PostgreSQL HA
- vip-manager: Read leader info from Etcd to bind an optional L2 VIP on the PostgreSQL cluster

You’ll have to [**reload**](/docs/etcd/admin/#reload-config) etcd config after any permanent change to the etcd cluster members.

e.g, update patroni reference to etcd endpoints:

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pg_conf                            # generate patroni config
ansible all -f 1 -b -a 'systemctl reload patroni' # reload patroni config
```

e.g, update vip-manager reference to etcd endpoints (if you are using PGSQL L2 VIP):

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pg_vip_config                           # generate vip-manager config
ansible all -f 1 -b -a 'systemctl restart vip-manager' # restart vip-manager to use
```
