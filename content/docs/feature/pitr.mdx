Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) allows rolling back a PostgreSQL cluster to any specific moment in the past, preventing data loss from software defects or human errors. Pigsty uses pgBackRest for PITR, with configurable backup strategies using local filesystems or object storage like MinIO.

<Callout type="info">
**Time Travel for Databases**: Roll back your cluster to any point in time, protecting against software defects, human errors, and data corruption scenarios that high availability cannot address.
</Callout>

## Overview

Pigsty provides **enterprise-grade Point-in-Time Recovery** with zero-configuration setup, automated backups, and flexible restore options. Built on pgBackRest with MinIO/S3 support, it protects against data corruption, human errors, and logical disasters.

## How PITR Works

PITR requires two key components working together to enable point-in-time recovery:

<Tabs items={['Base Backups', 'WAL Archiving']}>
  <Tab value="Base Backups">
    ### Base Backups
    
    Uses pgBackRest to create database cluster snapshots with multiple backup types:
    
    - **Full backups**: Complete database cluster snapshots
    - **Incremental backups**: Only changes since the last backup
    - **Differential backups**: Changes since the last full backup
    - **Scheduled backups**: Periodic backups configured via Crontab
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="WAL Archiving">
    ### WAL Archiving
    
    Continuously archives Write-Ahead Log (WAL) segment files:
    
    - **Continuous archiving**: Real-time WAL file preservation
    - **Automatic management**: WAL files and cleanup handled automatically
    - **Optional feature**: Can be disabled if PITR is not needed
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Implementation

Pigsty provides two default backup strategies with flexible configuration options:

<Tabs items={['Local Filesystem', 'MinIO/S3']}>
  <Tab value="Local Filesystem">
    ### Local Filesystem Strategy
    
    - **Frequency**: Daily full backups
    - **Storage**: Local filesystem storage
    - **Use case**: Single-node or local development environments
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="MinIO/S3">
    ### MinIO/S3 Strategy
    
    - **Frequency**: Weekly full backup with daily incremental backups
    - **Storage**: Object storage (MinIO, S3)
    - **Use case**: Production environments with distributed storage
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configuration Options

Backup configuration is highly flexible with options to specify:

- **Repository type**: Local, S3, or other supported backends
- **Retention policies**: How long to keep backups
- **Encryption**: Secure backup storage
- **Storage locations**: Multiple backup destinations

## Recovery Options

<Callout type="warning">
Recovery operations should be performed carefully as they will replace the current database state.
</Callout>

Recovery commands allow restoring to various points in time:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Latest WAL Archive
    Restore to the most recent point available in WAL archives:
    ```bash
    pg-pitr
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Specific Timestamp
    Restore to an exact moment in time:
    ```bash
    pg-pitr --time="2022-12-30 14:44:44+08"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Named Restore Point
    Restore to a previously created named point:
    ```bash
    pg-pitr --name="my-restore-point"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Specific LSN or Transaction ID
    Restore to a particular Log Sequence Number or transaction:
    ```bash
    pg-pitr --lsn="0/1234567"
    pg-pitr --xid="12345"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
While PITR is powerful for data recovery, it should ideally be combined with High Availability solutions for comprehensive data protection against both logical and physical failures.
