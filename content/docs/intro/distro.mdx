[PostgreSQL is eating the database world](https://medium.com/@fengruohang/postgres-is-eating-the-database-world-157c204dcfc4),
and it is becoming the Linux kernel of the database world.

**But where are the distributions?**

--------

## What is Distribution?

Nowadays, people use OS distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, and RHEL, rather than the raw Linux kernel directly.
You'll need a lot of components to build a practical operating system, such as systemd, cron, NTP, DNS, logging, ..., to make the raw Linux kernel usable.

The linux kernel is several MB in size, but a full OS DVD can easily take up 10+GB, including all the necessary parts and software packages.
That's what a PostgreSQL Distribution is all about —— Gives you everything to build a production-grade Database Service.

## Why do we need Distribution?

We have two things to forge a powerful PostgreSQL distribution: [Extensions](#extensions) and [Services](#services).


## Extensions

There are [1000+](https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47) extensions in the PostgreSQL ecosystem.
But only 100 of them are accessible via the "Official" PGDG Repositories.

So we packed the most popular and useful extensions into pre-made RPM/DEB packages for 10 linux distributions and 5 PG Major version.
Now there are unparalleled [422 extensions](/ext/list) available out-of-the-box, and we will continue to add more extensions in the future.

What's more, we even have support for 8 flavors of PostgreSQL kernels (ext, fork, wrapper, etc.), including:

| Kernel                                   | Key Feature              | Description                                      |

## Services

![](/img/pigsty/infra.png)

You can get started with raw PostgreSQL kernel easily like `systemctl start postgresql`, but it's far away from production grade service.
That's the main reason why people pay 160 $ / vCPU·Month for a managed PostgreSQL service like AWS RDS.

But what if you can just build an enterprise-grade PostgreSQL service on your own, with a few commands, and no license fees?
Pigsty enables you to do that. It gives you HA PostgreSQL clusters with PITR, Monitoring & Alerting, Connection Pooling, along with
