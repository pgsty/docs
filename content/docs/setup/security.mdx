Pigsty already provides a secure-by-default database [authentication](/docs/pgsql/hba/) and [access control](/docs/pgsql/acl) model.

It is strong enough for most common scenarios, as long as your follow the security best-practices below.



------

## Confidentiality

### Files

<Callout title="Secure your pigsty config file" type="warn">

- `pigsty.yml` hold very sensitive information like passwords
- Limit access to admin/infra nodes to admin/dba
- Limit access to repo, if you are manage pigsty config with GitOps

</Callout>

<Callout title="Secure your CA private key" type="warn">

- Generated at `~/pigsty/files/pki/ca/ca.key` by default
- Secure & backup it in a safe place, **DON'T THROW IT AWAY!**
- Also consider secure other private keys for various certs

</Callout>




------

### Passwords

<Callout title="DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT PASSWORDs" type="error">

Always change these default passwords in serious deployment

- [`grafana_admin_password`](/docs/infra/param/#grafana_admin_password) : `pigsty`
- [`pg_admin_password`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_admin_password) : `DBUser.DBA`
- [`pg_monitor_password`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_monitor_password) : `DBUser.Monitor`
- [`pg_replication_password`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_replication_password) : `DBUser.Replicator`
- [`patroni_password`](/docs/pgsql/param#patroni_password) : `Patroni.API`
- [`haproxy_admin_password`](/docs/node/param/#haproxy_admin_password) : `pigsty`
- [`minio_secret_key`](/docs/minio/param/#minio_secret_key) : `minioadmin`

</Callout>
    
<Callout title="Change MinIO credentials and pgbackrest references" type="warn">

If you are using MinIO as backup storage, also change these credentials:

- Change the password for [`minio_users`.`[pgbacrest\]`.`secret_key`](/docs/minio/param/#minio_users)
- Change pgbackrest references: [`pgbackrest_repo`.`minio`.`s3_key_secret`](/docs/pgsql/param#pgbackrest_repo)

</Callout>

<Callout title="Enforce strong pg password with the passwordcheck extension" type="warn">

- add `$lib/passwordcheck` to [`pg_libs`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_libs) to enforce password policy.
- stronger version: `passwordcheck_cracklib`

</Callout>

<Callout title="Encrypt remote backup with an encryption algorithm" type="warn">

- check [`pgbackrest_repo`](/docs/pgsql/param#pgbackrest_repo) definition `repo_cipher_type`
- `cipher_type: aes-256-cbc` by default 

</Callout>


<Callout title="Use advanced password encryption method for PostgreSQL" type="warn">

- use [`pg_pwd_enc`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_pwd_enc) default `scram-sha-256` instead of legacy `md5`
- default behavior is `scram-sha-256`, `md5` is deprecated

</Callout>

<Callout title="Add an expiration date to business user passwords" type="warn">

You can set an expiry date for each user for compliance purposes.

```yaml
- { name: dbuser_meta , password: Pleas3-ChangeThisPwd ,expire_in: 7300 ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [ dbrole_admin ]    ,comment: pigsty admin user }
- { name: dbuser_view , password: Make.3ure-Compl1ance  ,expire_in: 7300 ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [ dbrole_readonly ] ,comment: read-only viewer for meta database }
- { name: postgres     ,superuser: true  ,expire_in: 7300                        ,comment: system superuser }
- { name: replicator ,replication: true  ,expire_in: 7300 ,roles: [pg_monitor, dbrole_readonly]   ,comment: system replicator }
- { name: dbuser_dba   ,superuser: true  ,expire_in: 7300 ,roles: [dbrole_admin]  ,pgbouncer: true ,pool_mode: session, pool_connlimit: 16 , comment: pgsql admin user }
- { name: dbuser_monitor ,roles: [pg_monitor] ,expire_in: 7300 ,pgbouncer: true ,parameters: {log_min_duration_statement: 1000 } ,pool_mode: session ,pool_connlimit: 8 ,comment: pgsql monitor user }
```

Don't forget to refresh these expiry dates periodically with `pgsql-user.yml` playbook

</Callout>

<Callout title="Don't print password to logs" type="warn">

```bash
SET log_statement TO 'none';
ALTER USER "{{ user.name }}" PASSWORD '{{ user.password }}';
SET log_statement TO DEFAULT;
```

</Callout>



------

### IP Addresses

<Callout title="Bind specific IP addresses for postgres/pgbouncer/patroni" type="warn">

- The default [`pg_listen`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_listen) address is `0.0.0.0`, which is all IPv4 addresses.
- Consider using `pg_listen: '${ip},${vip},${lo}'` to bind to specific addresses for better security.

</Callout>

<Callout title="Do not expose any port to the Internet; except 80/443, the infra portal" type="warn">

- Grafana/Prometheus are bind to **all** IP address by default for convenience.
- You can modify their bind configuration to listen on localhost/intranet IP and expose by Nginx.
- Redis server are bind to **all** IP address by default for convenience. You can change [`redis_bind_address`](/docs/redis/param/#redis_bind_address) to listen on intranet IP.
- You can also implement it with the security group or firewall rules.

</Callout>

<Callout title="Limit postgres client access with HBA" type="warn">

- There's a security enhance config template: [`security.yml`](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/blob/main/conf/safe.yml)

</Callout>

<Callout title="Limit patroni admin access from the infra/admin node" type="warn">

- This is restricted by default with [`restapi.allowlist`](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/blob/main/roles/pgsql/templates/oltp.yml#L108)


</Callout>


------

### Network Traffic

<Callout title="Access Nginx with SSL and domain names" type="warn">

- Nginx SSL is controlled by [`nginx_sslmode`](/docs/infra/param/#haproxy_sslmode), which is `enable` by default.
- Nginx Domain names are specified by [`infra_portal..domain`](/docs/infra/param/#infra_portal).

</Callout>

<Callout title="Secure Patroni REST API with SSL" type="warn">

- [`patroni_ssl_enabled`](/docs/pgsql/param#patroni_ssl_enabled) is disabled by default
- Since it affects health checks and API invocation.
- Note this is a global option, and you have to decide before deployment.

</Callout>

<Callout title="Secure Pgbouncer Client Traffic with SSL" type="warn">

- [`pgbouncer_sslmode`](/docs/pgsql/param#pgbouncer_sslmode) is `disable` by default
- Since it has a significant performance impact.

</Callout>

------

## Integrity

### Consistency

<Callout title="Use consistency-first mode for PostgreSQL" type="warn">

- Use `crit.yml` templates for [`pg_conf`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_conf) will trade some availability for the best consistency.

</Callout>

<Callout title="Use node crit tuned template for better consistency" type="warn">

- set [`node_tune`](/docs/node/param/#node_tune) to `crit` to reduce dirty page ratio.

- Enable data checksum to detect silent data corruption.
- [`pg_checksum`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_checksum) is disabled by default, and enabled for `crit.yml` by default
- This can be enabled later, which requires a full cluster scan/stop.

</Callout>

### Audit

<Callout title="Enable connection logging for audit" type="warn">

- Enable `log_connections` and `log_disconnections` after the pg cluster bootstrap.
- Audit incoming sessions; this is enabled in `crit.yml` by default.

</Callout>

### Fat Finger

<Callout title="DO NOT RE-RUN install.yml PLAYBOOK" type="error">
    Running `install.yml` again will nuke (overwrite) the entire deployment!
</Callout>

<Callout title="RE-RUN pgsql.yml WITH CAUTION" type="warn">
    It will OVERWRITE existing PostgreSQL by default before v3.5.

    Use `pg_safeguard` to avoid fat fingers
</Callout>




------

## Availability

### Redundancy

<Callout title="Use enough nodes for serious production deployment" type="warn">

- You need at least three nodes (tolerate one node failure) to achieve production-grade high availability.
- If you only have two nodes, you can tolerate the failure of the specific standby node.
- If you have one node, use an external S3/MinIO for cold backup & wal archive storage.

</Callout>

<Callout title="Use multiple infra nodes in serious production deployment" type="warn">

- Use multiple infra nodes in serious production deployment (e.g., 1~3)
- Usually, 2 ~ 3 is enough for a large production deployment.

</Callout>

<Callout title="Use enough etcd members and use odd numbers" type="warn">

- Use enough etcd members and use odd numbers (1,3,5,7).
- Check [ETCD Configuration](/docs/etcd/config/) for details.

</Callout>


### Fault Tolerance

<Callout title="Trade off between availability and consistency for PostgreSQL" type="warn">

- [`pg_rpo`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_rpo) : **trade-off between Availability and Consistency**
- [`pg_rto`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_rto) : **trade-off between failure chance and impact**

</Callout>

### Access

<Callout title="Use VIP, DNS, HAProxy instead of fixed IP" type="warn">

- Do not access the database directly via a fixed IP address; use VIP, DNS, HAProxy, or their combination.
- Haproxy will handle the traffic control for the clients in case of failover/switchover.

</Callout>
