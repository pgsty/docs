## ABORT due to postgres exists

> Set `pg_clean` = `true` and `pg_safeguard` = `false` to force clean postgres data during `pgsql.yml`

This happens when you run `pgsql.yml` on a node with postgres running, and [`pg_clean`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_clean) is set to `false`.

If `pg_clean` is true (and the `pg_safeguard` is `false`, too), the `pgsql.yml` playbook will remove the existing pgsql data and re-init it as a new one, which makes this playbook fully idempotent.

You can still purge the existing PostgreSQL data by using a special task tag `pg_purge`

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pg_clean      # honor pg_clean and pg_safeguard
./pgsql.yml -t pg_purge      # ignore pg_clean and pg_safeguard
```

------

## ABORT due to pg_safeguard enabled

> Disable `pg_safeguard` to remove the Postgres instance.

If [`pg_safeguard`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_safeguard) is enabled, you can not remove the running pgsql instance with `bin/pgsql-rm` and `pgsql-rm.yml` playbook.

To disable `pg_safeguard`, you can set `pg_safeguard` to `false` in the inventory or pass `-e pg_safeguard=false` as cli arg to the playbook:

```bash
./pgsql-rm.yml -e pg_safeguard=false -l <cls_to_remove>    # force override pg_safeguard
```

## Fail to wait for postgres/patroni primary

There are several possible reasons for this error, and you need to [check](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/discussions/338) the system logs to determine the actual cause.

This usually happens when the cluster is misconfigured, or the previous primary is improperly removed. (e.g., trash metadata in DCS with the same cluster name).

You must check `/pg/log/*` to find the reason.

To delete trash meta from etcd, you can use `etcdctl del --prefix /pg/<cls>`, do with caution!

- 1: Misconfiguration. Identify the incorrect parameters, modify them, and apply the changes.
- 2: Another cluster with the same cls name already exists in the deployment
- 3: The previous cluster on the node, or previous cluster with same name was not correctly removed.
- To remove obsolete cluster metadata, you can use `etcdctl del --prefix /pg/<cls>` to manually delete the residual data.
- 4: The RPM packages related to your PostgreSQL or node were not successfully installed.
- 5: Your Watchdog kernel module was not correctly enabled or loaded, but required.
- 6: The locale or ctype specified `pg_lc_collate` and `pg_lc_ctype` does not exist in OS

Feel free to submit an issue or seek help from the community.

## Fail to wait for postgres/patroni replica

**Failed Immediately**: Usually, this happens because of misconfiguration, network issues, broken DCS metadata, etc…, you have to inspect `/pg/log` to find out the actual reason.

**Failed After a While**: This may be due to source instance data corruption. Check PGSQL FAQ: How to create replicas when data is corrupted?

**Timeout**: If the `wait for postgres replica` task takes 30min or more and fails due to timeout, This is common for a huge cluster (e.g., 1TB+, which may take hours to create a replica). In this case, the underlying creating replica procedure is still proceeding. You can check cluster status with `pg list <cls>` and wait until the replica catches up with the primary. Then continue the following tasks:

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pg_hba,pg_param,pg_backup,pgbouncer,pg_vip,pg_dns,pg_service,pg_exporter,pg_register -l <problematic_replica>
```

## Install PostgreSQL 12 - 15

To install PostgreSQL 12 - 15, you have to set `pg_version` to `12`, `13`, `14`, or `15` in the inventory. (usually at cluster level)

```yaml
pg_version: 16                    # install pg 16 in this template
pg_libs: 'pg_stat_statements, auto_explain' # remove timescaledb from pg 16 beta
pg_extensions: []                 # missing pg16 extensions for now
```

## How enable hugepage for PostgreSQL?

> use `node_hugepage_count` and `node_hugepage_ratio` or `/pg/bin/pg-tune-hugepage`

If you plan to enable hugepage, consider using `node_hugepage_count` and `node_hugepage_ratio` and apply with `./node.yml -t node_tune` .

It’s good to allocate **enough** hugepage before postgres start, and use `pg_tune_hugepage` to shrink them later.

If your postgres is already running, you can use `/pg/bin/pg-tune-hugepage` to enable hugepage on the fly. Note that this only works on PostgreSQL 15+

```bash
sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches   # drop system cache (ready for performance impact)
sudo /pg/bin/pg-tune-hugepage             # write nr_hugepages to /etc/sysctl.d/hugepage.conf
pg restart <cls>                          # restart postgres to use hugepage
```

## How to guarantee zero data loss during failover?

> Use `crit.yml` template, or setting `pg_rpo` to `0`, or [config cluster](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/admin/#config-cluster) with synchronous mode.

Consider using [Sync Standby](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/config/#sync-standby) and [Quorum Comit](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/config/#quorum-commit) to guarantee 0 data loss during failover.

## How to survive from disk full?

> `rm -rf /pg/dummy` will free some emergency space.

The [`pg_dummy_filesize`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_dummy_filesize) is set to `64MB` by default. Consider increasing it to `8GB` or larger in the production environment.

It will be placed on `/pg/dummy` same disk as the PGSQL main data disk. You can remove that file to free some emergency space. At least you can run some shell scripts on that node.

## How to create replicas when data is corrupted?

> Disable `clonefrom` on bad instances and reload patroni config.

Pigsty sets the `cloneform: true` tag on all instances’ patroni config, which marks the instance available for cloning replica.

If this instance has corrupt data files, you can set `clonefrom: false` to avoid pulling data from the evil instance. To do so:

```bash
$ vi /pg/bin/patroni.yml

tags:
  nofailover: false
  clonefrom: true      # ----------> change to false
  noloadbalance: false
  nosync: false
  version:  '15'
  spec: '4C.8G.50G'
  conf: 'oltp.yml'

$ systemctl reload patroni
```

## Performance impact of monitoring exporter

Not very much, 200ms per 10 ~ 15 seconds, won’t affect the database performance.

The default scrape interval for prometheus is 10s in pigsty, make sure the exporter can finish the scrape within that period.

## How to remove monitor targets from prometheus?

```bash
./pgsql-rm.yml -t prometheus -l <cls>     # remove prometheus targets of cluster 'cls'
```

Or

```bash
bin/pgmon-rm <ins>     # shortcut for removing prometheus targets of pgsql instance 'ins'
```
