## ABORT due to existing redis instance

> use `redis_clean = true` and `redis_safeguard = false` to force clean redis data

This happens when you run `redis.yml` to init a redis instance that is already running, and [`redis_clean`](/docs/redis/param/#redis_clean) is set to `false`.

If `redis_clean` is set to `true` (and the `redis_safeguard` is set to `false`, too), the `redis.yml` playbook will remove the existing redis instance and re-init it as a new one, which makes the `redis.yml` playbook fully idempotent.

You can disable [`redis_safeguard`](/docs/redis/param/#redis_safeguard) to remove the Redis instance. This is redis_safeguard is what it is for.
