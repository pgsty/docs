## Accidental Data Deletion

For small-batch `DELETE` operations performed in error, consider using the `pg_surgery` extension for in-place surgical recovery.

If the deleted data has already been reclaimed by VACUUM, follow the general data loss recovery workflow.


## Accidental Object Deletion

When `DROP/DELETE` operations are performed in error, follow this workflow to determine the recovery approach:

1. Verify if the data can be recovered through business systems or other data sources. If possible, recover directly from the business side.
2. Check for delayed replica availability. If available, advance the delayed replica to the point before deletion and query the data for recovery.
3. If data is confirmed deleted, verify backup coverage for the deletion timepoint. If covered, initiate PITR.
4. Determine whether to perform in-place PITR rollback on the entire cluster, replay on a new server, or use a replica for replay, then execute the recovery strategy.


## Accidental Cluster Deletion

In cases where an entire database cluster is accidentally deleted, such as mistakenly executing the `pgsql-rm.yml` playbook:
Unless you explicitly specified `pg_rm_backup: false` beforehand, backups will typically be deleted along with the database cluster.
