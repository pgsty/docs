[PolarDB](https://openpolardb.com/home) is an aurora RAC flavor "cloud native" database system developed & open-sourced by Aliyun.

The latest version is [v15.15.5.0](https://github.com/ApsaraDB/PolarDB-for-PostgreSQL), compatible with PostgreSQL 15,
and available on all linux distributions supported by Pigsty.


------

## Get Started

[**install**](/install/start) Pigsty’s with the [`polar`](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/blob/main/conf/polar.yml) config template.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.io/get | bash; cd ~/pigsty;
./configure -c polar     # Use polar (PolarDB) template
./install.yml            # Run Deployment Playbook
```



------

## Configure

The following parameters need to be tuned to deploy a PolarDB cluster:

```yaml
pg-meta:
  hosts:
    10.10.10.10: { pg_seq: 1, pg_role: primary }
  vars:
    pg_cluster: pg-meta
    pg_users:
      - {name: dbuser_meta ,password: DBUser.Meta   ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_admin]    ,comment: pigsty admin user }
      - {name: dbuser_view ,password: DBUser.Viewer ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_readonly] ,comment: read-only viewer for meta database }
    pg_databases:
      - {name: meta ,baseline: cmdb.sql ,comment: pigsty meta database ,schemas: [pigsty]}
    pg_hba_rules:
      - {user: dbuser_view , db: all ,addr: infra ,auth: pwd ,title: 'allow grafana dashboard access cmdb from infra nodes'}
    node_crontab: [ '00 01 * * * postgres /pg/bin/pg-backup full' ] # make a full backup every 1am

    # PolarDB Ad Hoc Settings
    pg_version: 15                            # PolarDB PG is based on PG 15
    pg_mode: polar                            # PolarDB PG Compatible mode
    pg_packages: [ polardb, pgsql-common ]    # Replace PG kernel with PolarDB kernel
    pg_exporter_exclude_database: 'template0,template1,postgres,polardb_admin'
    pg_default_roles:                         # PolarDB require replicator as superuser
      - { name: dbrole_readonly  ,login: false ,comment: role for global read-only access     }
      - { name: dbrole_offline   ,login: false ,comment: role for restricted read-only access }
      - { name: dbrole_readwrite ,login: false ,roles: [dbrole_readonly] ,comment: role for global read-write access }
      - { name: dbrole_admin     ,login: false ,roles: [pg_monitor, dbrole_readwrite] ,comment: role for object creation }
      - { name: postgres     ,superuser: true  ,comment: system superuser }
      - { name: replicator   ,superuser: true  ,replication: true ,roles: [pg_monitor, dbrole_readonly] ,comment: system replicator } # <- superuser is required for replication
      - { name: dbuser_dba   ,superuser: true  ,roles: [dbrole_admin]  ,pgbouncer: true ,pool_mode: session, pool_connlimit: 16 ,comment: pgsql admin user }
      - { name: dbuser_monitor ,roles: [pg_monitor] ,pgbouncer: true ,parameters: {log_min_duration_statement: 1000 } ,pool_mode: session ,pool_connlimit: 8 ,comment: pgsql monitor user }

```

------

## Client Access

PolarDB for PostgreSQL is essentially equivalent to PostgreSQL 15, and any client tools compatible with the PostgreSQL wire protocol can access the PolarDB cluster.

## Extensions

Most of the **PGSQL** module’s [**extension**](/pgsql/extension/) (non pure-SQL) cannot be used directly on the PolarDB kernel. If you need to use them, you need to recompile and install from source code for the new kernel.

Currently, the PolarDB kernel comes with the following **61** extension plugins. In addition to Contrib extensions, the additional extensions provided include:
